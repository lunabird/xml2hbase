	/**
	 * A dictionary used to store <code>prefix</code> or <code>localpart</code> QName components.
	 * 
	 * <P>At present this could be just a straight {@link Dictionary}. In past
	 * (and possibly in future) a <code>TextDictionary</code> subclass can provide
	 * slightly different behaviour for "real" word content, such as ignoring
	 * case on lookup (a desirable option for full-text).
	 * 
	 * <P><B>NOTA</B>: Underlying dictionary implementation is still evolving.
	 * Eg, at present separate dictionaries are dedicated to prefixes and
	 * localparts, for both elements and attributes. I will review whether these
	 * continue to require separate structures or whether they can and/or should be consolidated.
	 * 
	 * <P>As well, the underlying {@link WordListHashtable} implementation seems reasonably
	 * efficient as a storage device, but does not allow alphabetic storage and retrieval.
	 * I may swap this out.
